|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| List Your Achievements        | Write down 10 technical achievements where you **took initiative** (even small ones like raising tickets or troubleshooting issues) | 30 mins | Helps you see you're already a leader in small ways |
| Learn Assertive Communication | Read **"The Assertiveness Workbook" by Randy Paterson** or listen to podcasts like **"The Art of Speaking Up"** | 15 mins/day | Helps you communicate without sounding apologetic |

|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Mentorship Practice | Offer help to junior engineers in your team (even if they don't ask) | Once a week | Builds respect + shows leadership without title |
| Collaborative Language | Use phrases like **"Let's decide together"** instead of **"What do you think?"** | Daily | Positions you as someone who guides the team |
| Conflict Response | When someone challenges your decision (like Sonali did), calmly ask: **"Can you explain why you think that's the best approach?"** | Case-by-case | Makes you sound confident, not defensive |

### **Month 3: Project Leadership (Execution)**
ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Take ownership and **drive a small initiative** independently.

| Action               | How to Do It                 | Time Commitment | Outcome                  |

| Pick a Small Project | Propose a minor automation, documentation, or cleanup task to your manager | 1 hour/week | Shows you're taking initiative |
| Weekly Syncs       | Send a **summary email every Friday** to your team/manager with progress updates | 15 mins | Establishes you as the person who **drives outcomes** |
| Team Inclusion     | Ask teammates for their input in public forums (Slack, Email) â€” **even if you're 100% sure of the solution** | Daily | Makes others see you as a collaborative leader |
